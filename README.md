# Solutions to Exercises, Drills, and Review Questions from Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition)

## What's included?
This is currently a work in progress, but hopefully by the time you read this, I will have published the answers to every exercise, drill, and review question from chapter 3 to the end of the book.

## Where is this repo located?
This repo originally exists on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/hossein/PPPCplusplusSolutions/src/branch/main), however it's also mirrored on my GitHub account since some people use GitHub's search instead of a search engine. 

## Notes
1. I have used GCC 11.3.0, GNU dialect of -std=c++17, to compile the pieces of code in this repository.
2. I did not use `std_lib_facilities.h`, instead, I have imported standard libraries on a per-need basis.
3. The answers in the beginning chapters could improve substantially if one were to use the concepts introduced in the next chapters, but I have also avoided this in order to stick to the material in the book.

## License
It is obvious that I don't own the copyright to questions from Bjarne Stroustrup's book, their order, or even some of my answers that I have relied heavily on the text of the book to write.
The material that is not under the book's copyright, that is, the parts that are my own work, are published under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license. I chose this license because it's applicable to both text and software.
